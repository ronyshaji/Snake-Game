# Snake Game

Snake Game is a simple 2D C++ based game which is inspired from a Stackoverflow post and set of ansers to the post. The game is improvised with additional features and as a part of the project, some new features are added to the Snake Game, which makes it more like a real game. It uses the SDL game programming library in order to render and display the elements of the game.

The SDL library(opens in a new tab) is widely used for Game development as a tool to abstract the hardware so you don't need to worry about working with the hardware directly. SDL manages video, audio, input devices, and other components and provides you with a simple library interface.

## Snake Game Improvements and New Features

The Snake Game has been significantly improved with the addition of new features, making it more user-friendly and interactive. The key additions are:

 - **Pause/Resume Functionality:** Users can now pause and resume the game using keyboard inputs.
 - **Player Name Input:** Ability to enter the name of the player at game start.
 - **Game Difficulty Selection:** Players can choose the difficulty level (Easy or Hard) at the beginning of the game.
 - **Score and Player Name Saving:** The player's name and score are saved to a text file, allowing users to keep track of their performance.
 - **Special Food:** Special food appears randomly and changes the food's appearance in the game along with multiple score.

### Following concepts of C++ are used in this project:
  - Object Oriented Programming
  - Multithreading 
  - Memory Management using smart pointers
  - Loops, Functions and other basic c++ features

In the following sections, we will provide a detailed explanation of the newly added features. Additionally, we will cover the C++ concepts used in this project, offering a deeper understanding of the current implementation.

### 1) Pause/Resume Functionality

For this feature, a new function called `pauseGame()` is added in the `controller.h` file. The logic is simple and based on the earlier implementation where a function takes input from the keyboard using `SDL_Event`. The keyboard key `'p'` is mapped to a function, such that when the key `'p'` is pressed, it pauses the game using `std::cin`, which essentially waits for input from the keyboard. This implementation is straightforward and effective for pausing the game.

```cpp
void Controller::pauseGame() const
{
  std::cout << "Game paused" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "enter 'S' to continue" << std::endl;
  std::g etline(std::cin, key_);
} 
```

### 2) Player Name Input

This feature allows identifying the player by capturing their name. The player's name is entered via the keyboard and stored in a `std::string`, making it available for use later, such as saving it to a text file. This functionality is implemented in the newly added file `speedcontrol.cpp` within the `getPlayerName()` function, which handles capturing the input from the user.

```cpp
void speedcontrol::getPlayerName()
{
  std::cout << "Please Enter your name" << std::endl;
  std::getline(std::cin, playerName_);
}
```
### 3) Game Difficulty Selection

This feature enhances the Snake Game by making the gameplay more intuitive through adjustable difficulty levels. The game asks the player to select a difficulty level at the start, which determines the initial speed of the snake. There are two difficulty levels: **Easy** and **Hard**, where the snake starts at different speeds. As the snake eats more food and grows, its speed increases.

This feature is implemented in the `speedcontrol.cpp` file. It uses several member functions and conditional statements to initialize the snake's speed based on the selected difficulty level before the game begins.


```cpp
oid speedcontrol::setSelection()
{
    switch(selection_)
    {
        case 1:
            speed_ = 0.1f;
            break;
        case 2:
            speed_ = 0.5f;
            break;
    }

}
```
To make the game more user-friendly, a nice UI is provided in the terminal when starting the game. This UI prompts the player to select the desired difficulty level in a visually appealing manner. The user can choose between **Easy** and **Hard** difficulty levels, which affect the initial speed of the snake. This enhances the overall gameplay experience by giving the player control over the game's difficulty.

### 4) Score and Player Name Saving

It's always beneficial to store the player's name and score for future reference, whether to track the highest score or for historical purposes. In this project, at the end of the gameplay, the playerâ€™s name and corresponding score are written to a text file named **Gamestatics.txt**. This file is created if it doesn't exist, and if it does, the latest game details are **appended** at the end. This ensures that the latest data is always available at the bottom of the text file.

This functionality is implemented in the `game.cpp` file inside a function called `writeName()`. The function takes the playerâ€™s name from `speedcontrol.cpp` and writes it along with the score to the text file.



```cpp
void Game::writeName() 
{
  std::ofstream outputFile;
  outputFile.open("Gamestatics.txt", std::ios::app);

  auto playername = control->printPlayerName();
  if(outputFile){
    outputFile << "Player Name: " << playername << ", Score: " << score << std::endl;
    outputFile.close();
    std::cout << "The player Name and score was written to the file: Gamestatics.txt" << std::endl;
  }
  else {
    std::cerr << "File cannot be opened !!" << std::endl;
  }
}
```
 
### 5) Special Food Feature in the Snake Game  

This feature introduces **special food** that appears randomly alongside normal food. A **separate thread** is started, ensuring that special food spawns at random intervals and remains visible for approximately **10 seconds** before disappearing.  

#### Visual Difference  
- **Normal food** ðŸŸ¡ is rendered in **yellow**.  
- **Special food** ðŸ”´ is rendered in **red**.  

#### Gameplay Impact  
- Eating **normal food** increases the score by `+1`.  
- Catching **special food** doubles the reward, increasing the score by `+2`.  

#### Pausing Mechanism  
When the game is paused, the **special food thread also pauses** and resumes automatically once the game continues. This behavior makes the feature feel more dynamic and closer to a real game experience.  

#### Concurrency & Threading  
This feature effectively utilizes:  

```cpp
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx); // Ensures safe access to shared resources
std::mutex mtx;                        // Prevents race conditions
std::condition_variable pauseCv;       // Synchronizes the special food thread with game state changes
```

<center><img src="images/snake-gif.gif"/></center>

```cpp
void Game::specialFoodThread() {
  while (running)
  {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(dist(engine)));

    //Pause the thread till a condition is fulfilled: Needed for the game pause feature
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lockk(mtx);
    pauseCv.wait(lockk, [this] { return !isPaused; });

    lockk.unlock();

    SDL_Point tempfood;
    PlaceFood(tempfood);
    {
      std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
      specialFood_ = tempfood;
      specialFoodActive = true;
    }
    bool overlap = false;
    { 
      std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
      overlap = ((specialFood_.x == food.x) && (specialFood_.y == food.y));
    }
    if (overlap)
    {
      PlaceFood(tempfood);
      {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        specialFood_ = tempfood;
      }
      specialFoodActive = true;
    }
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(10));
    {
      std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
      specialFoodActive = false;
    }
  }
}
```

### Object Oriented Programming

1) One class is added to the project with appropriate access specifiers for class members
2) Class constructors utilize member initialization lists
3) Classes abstract implementation details from their interface

A new class `speedcontrol` is created inside the `speedcontrol.h` file in order to get the input from the user for the game difficulty selection. This class has public and private member variables and methods.

- **In speedcontrol.h/cpp**  
  Added a new class speedcontrol with public and private attributes  [Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/6fc26205aaa1f5237e8a5fe3d4b774af2f2ea044/src/speedcontrol.h#L8)

- **In snake.h**

  Initialise the member functions of class speedcontrol using the object.  [Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/6fc26205aaa1f5237e8a5fe3d4b774af2f2ea044/src/snake.h#L49)  

- **In game.cpp**  
  Modified the order of the parameter list of Game class constructor  [Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/6fc26205aaa1f5237e8a5fe3d4b774af2f2ea044/src/game.cpp#L10)  
  Initiliase the memory dynamically inside the Game class constructor for the speedcontrol class object  [Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/6fc26205aaa1f5237e8a5fe3d4b774af2f2ea044/src/game.cpp#L11)  

### Memory Management

1) The project makes use of references in function declarations
2) The project uses destructors appropriately
3) The project uses scope / Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) where appropriate


- **In game.h/cpp**  
  Declared a dynamic object of class speedcontrol as private (speedcontrol *control;)  [Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/6fc26205aaa1f5237e8a5fe3d4b774af2f2ea044/src/game.h#L25)  
  Deleted the dynamic allocated variable control inside constructor  [Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/6fc26205aaa1f5237e8a5fe3d4b774af2f2ea044/src/game.h#L21)  
  In constructor, pass the pointer in the Snake class  [Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/6fc26205aaa1f5237e8a5fe3d4b774af2f2ea044/src/game.cpp#L12)  
  Used the control object to access the member methods  [Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/6fc26205aaa1f5237e8a5fe3d4b774af2f2ea044/src/game.cpp#L67)  

- **In snake.h/cpp**  
  Declared a dynamic object of class speedcontrol as private (speedcontrol *controlSnake_;)  [Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/6fc26205aaa1f5237e8a5fe3d4b774af2f2ea044/src/snake.h#L49)  
  Initialised in the constructor with the value from the Game class  [Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/6fc26205aaa1f5237e8a5fe3d4b774af2f2ea044/src/snake.h#L14)  
  Used the control object to acess the member methods  [Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/6fc26205aaa1f5237e8a5fe3d4b774af2f2ea044/src/snake.h#L21)  

### Multi Threading

1) The project make use of multi threading where a separate thread along with main thread for special food.
2) It utilizes `std::mutex`, `std::unique_lock`, `std::lock_guard`, `std::conditional_variable`

- **In game.h/cpp**   
  Declared a function called `specialFoodThread()` which is run by a separate thread[Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/9c8c0951bfc44055e517a808523045a9f9d97c28/src/game.cpp#L101)  
  The shared variable are locked using std::mutex.  
  The thread fucntion is started in a function called `StartSpecialFoodThread()`[Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/9c8c0951bfc44055e517a808523045a9f9d97c28/src/game.cpp#L90)  
  The thread is stopped inside the destructor of the Game class by calling the function `StopSpecialFoodThread()`[Link](https://github.com/ronyshaji/Snake-Game/blob/9c8c0951bfc44055e517a808523045a9f9d97c28/src/game.cpp#L94)
